-- Q27.1 When we introduced parameterized types in
-- lesson 15, you used a minimal type Box as the example:
data Box a = Box a
    deriving Show
-- Implement the Functor type class for Box. Then implement
-- morePresents, which changes a box from type Box a to one
-- of type Box [a], which has n copies of the original
-- value in the box in a list. Make sure to use fmap to
-- implement this.
instance Functor Box where
    fmap f (Box x) = Box $ f x

morePresents :: Int -> Box a -> Box [a]
morePresents n = fmap $ replicate n


-- QC27.2 Now suppose you have a simple box like this:
myBox :: Box Int
myBox = Box 1
-- Use fmap to put the value in your Box in another Box.
-- Then define a function unwrap that takes a value out of
-- a box, and use fmap on that function to get your original
-- box. Hereâ€™s how your code should work in GHCi:
-- GHCi> wrapped = fmap ? myBox
-- GHCi> wrapped
-- Box (Box 1)
-- GHCi> fmap unwrap wrapped
-- Box 1
wrapped :: Box (Box Int)
wrapped = fmap Box myBox

-- Q27.3 Write a command-line interface for partsDB that
-- lets the user look up the cost of an item, given an ID.
-- Use the Maybe type to handle the case of the user
-- entering missing input.
