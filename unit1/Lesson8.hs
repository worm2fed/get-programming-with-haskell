-- Q8.2 Calculating Fibonacci numbers is perhaps the
-- single most common example of a recursive function. The
-- most straightforward definition is as follows:
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

-- Like the Ackermann function, this implementation quickly
-- explodes due to the mutually recursive calls. But unlike
-- the Ackermann function, thereâ€™s a much more efficient way
-- to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Write a function,
-- fastFib, that can compute the 1,000th Fibonacci number
-- nearly instantly.
-- Hint: fastFib takes three arguments: n1, n2, and counter.
-- To calculate the 1,000th Fibonacci number, you call
-- fastFib 1 1 1000 and for the 5th, you call fastFib 1 1 5.
