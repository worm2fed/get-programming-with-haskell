-- Q30.1 To prove that Monad is strictly more powerful than

-- preceding lessonâ€™s exercise, called allFmapM, that
-- defines <$> for all members of the Monad type class.
-- Because it works for all instances of Monad, the only
-- functions you can use are the methods required by the
-- Monad type class (and lambda functions).

-- Q30.2 To prove that Monad is strictly more powerful than
-- Applicative, write a universal version of <*>, called
-- allApp, that defines <*> for all members of the Monad
-- type class. Because it works for all instances of Monad,
-- the only functions you can use are the meth- ods required
-- by the Monad type class (and lambda functions).
-- This question is much trickier than the last one.
-- Two hints:
--      - Try to think exclusively in terms of the type
--          signatures.
--      - Use <$> if you want and replace it with your
--          answer to Q29.1
